# Kanban Board

A modern Kanban board application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, designed for efficient task management. This project allows users to organize tasks across different stages, ensuring a smooth workflow from "To Do" to "Completed".

## Features

- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Utilizes the DnD Kit for a seamless drag-and-drop experience to move tasks between columns.
- **Real-time Updates**: Tasks are dynamically updated in the UI, ensuring users always see the latest state without needing to refresh.
- **Unique Task Titles**: Prevents duplicate tasks with the same title within a column to maintain clarity in task management.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Task Prioritization**: Each task can be assigned a priority (High, Medium, Low) for better organization and focus.
- **Due Dates**: Tasks can include due dates, helping users track deadlines effectively.
- **Authentication**: Integrates **NextAuth** for user authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and a better development experience.
- **DnD Kit**: Library for implementing drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Prisma**: ORM for managing the database.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanban-board.git

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
